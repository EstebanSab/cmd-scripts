@echo off
tasklist /fi "status eq running" > RunningTasks.txt

echo Running task list has been saved to RunningTasks.txt.
pause



In this script:

The tasklist /fi command is executed with the filter option /fi "status eq running". This filters the task list to only include running processes.

The output of the command is redirected using the > symbol to a file named RunningTasks.txt. The > symbol tells the Command Prompt to redirect the output to a file instead of displaying it on the screen.

The echo command displays a message indicating that the running task list has been saved to the file.

The pause command is included to keep the Command Prompt window open after executing the script, allowing you to read the message before the window closes.

After executing the script, a file named RunningTasks.txt will be created in the same directory as the script. It will contain the contents of the running task list. You can open the file using a text editor to view the saved information.
