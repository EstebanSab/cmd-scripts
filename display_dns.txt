@echo off
ipconfig /displaydns > DNSCache.txt

echo DNS resolver cache has been saved to DNSCache.txt.
pause





The ipconfig /displaydns command is executed, which displays the contents of the DNS resolver cache.

The output of the command is redirected using the > symbol to a file named DNSCache.txt. The > symbol tells the Command Prompt to redirect the output to a file instead of displaying it on the screen.

The echo command displays a message indicating that the DNS resolver cache has been saved to the file.

The pause command is included to keep the Command Prompt window open after executing the script, allowing you to read the message before the window closes.

After executing the script, a file named DNSCache.txt will be created in the same directory as the script. It will contain the contents of the DNS resolver cache. You can open the file using a text editor to view the saved information.
