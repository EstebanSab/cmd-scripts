The for /L loop iterates from 1 to 254, with the variable %%i representing the current number in the loop.
The ip variable is set to the corresponding IP address using the set command.
The ping command is executed with the -n 1 option to send only one ping request to the specified IP address.
The findstr command filters the output of the ping command to search for the "Reply" keyword, indicating a successful ping response.
If the errorlevel is 0 (indicating a successful ping response), the script displays a message that the host is reachable.
